## Description
A full length 16bit ISA card for mounting hard disks (aka a HardCard). Please note, it's not a hard drive controller but a convenient method of mounting hard drives in legacy systems

**Features**
* Mount up to 3 x 2.5" hard disks
* Mount up to 2 x 3.5" hard disks
* Optionally power the hard Disks directly from the card, by attaching Molex or SATA power cables to any of the 5 x power points
* Useful in PCs and can also be used in the ISA slots of Big Box Amigas as it only needs the ISA slots for power
* Power LED
